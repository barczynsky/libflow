# libflow (v0.1)

## What's that?

libflow is a simple yet robust data-flow pipeline library written using C++11.

- while following SYR principle, it can be (re)used almost everywhere

## Compiling

libflow currently supports and probably compiles well under Linux or any Unix-like. That is all given using rather recent version of gcc - any (GOOD) C++11 compiler should do actually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barczynsky/libflow.git
cd libflow
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

After that you will end up with the main library (libflow.a) and a simple set of examples, usually presenting recent features and fixes.

- Recommended C++ standard used for compiling is C++14. Only some minor elements of it may be in actual use, but this alone needs a C++14 compiler or support of high enough standard extensions. Will also compile in less recent C++11, and for stable systems it is advised to do so.
